## CultureMatch

### Punchline
CultureMatch is a platform that matches job seekers with employers who prioritize shared values, well-being, and transparency. We help people find workplaces where they thrive, recharge, and grow through their work, not despite it.

### Executive Summary
Our platform addresses the challenge of finding workplaces that prioritize employee well-being and cultural fit, going beyond the standard job-matching platforms. Existing job search solutions often fail to provide accurate insights into company culture, leading to mismatches and employee dissatisfaction. Companies can self-report their culture on most platforms, resulting in biased information that doesnâ€™t reflect the real employee experience. This lack of transparency in work culture ratings makes it hard for job seekers to find workplaces where they can truly thrive. We strive for complete transparency, evaluating company values, culture and energy to match job seekers with the best possible positions for them.

### Problem
According to Americal Psychological Association, more than 50% of people have experiences stress related to the workplace. Moreover, more than 75% have experienced burnout (Mental Health America). If this was not bad enough, workplace related burnout rates keep rising. Currently available similar platforms, like AistiHealth, focus on employee well-being; however, they do not provide job searching services. Other platforms, such as LinkedIn or Indeed, only take skills into account, ignoring mental health completely.

### Solution
We created a platform that combines the best of both worlds - CultureMatch is a well-being and company culture based platform with a job searching functionality that focuses on employee mental health. We use company-provided and anonymous employee-provided data to ensure full company transparency. The platform is oriented at employees and job seekers, as they can access unbiased information about any company and receive personalized open position suggestions in accordance to their values.

### Technical information
Behind the scenes we are processing the anonymously provided data using AI. The processing is quite complex - we use semantic search to evaluate responses based on their meaning and context, and vector embeddings to compare data points and determine the sentiment. Then we calculate several company culture and employee satisfaction metrics based on the responses. From these metrics we can draw conclusions about the culture type of the company.
